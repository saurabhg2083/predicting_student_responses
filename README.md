# student_responses_prediction
Aim: Accurately predict which answers the students will choose  Part 1: To predict whether the student will get an answer right or wrong Part 2: To predict the exact option the student will choose in a test

Some factors to consider:

Student's Age and Time of Completion
There is a huge difference between students who have just turned 10 and those who have been 10 for nearly a year. It's important to consider the student's age in detail as there can be substantial differences in knowledge based on a studentâ€™s age. Exams are generally standardised by how old a student is in terms of year and month.

As the children age, it is also to consider their progress through the two years. It may be useful to see if you can calculate or predict their rate of improvement. 

Student's Skills
Students may have different skill sets. You can consider analysing students by literary skills, such as vocabulary, punctuation, knowledge of idioms etc.

Question Topic
This is quite similar to assessing the student's skills but more so their application of them. The majority of questions have been labelled with their topic. You can consider analysing a student's comprehensive ability in terms of factual recall, inference, SPaG (spelling, punctuation and grammar), vocabulary, purpose etc.

Difficulty of Question
You can also consider the difficulty of each question. There are easier factual recall questions and harder factual recall questions. You can consider calculating each question's Difficulty Index and Discrimination Index.

Text
You may consider the genre of the text (Fiction, Non-Fiction, Poetry etc), length of the text, the complexity of the text (vocabulary, sentence structures), and time in which it was written. All of these factors influence a student's ability to comprehend the text. Just because they know all the words in a passage does not necessarily mean they understand what is happening. Some metrics that may be useful include the Lexile score of a text, or its ATOS level etc.

Worksheet vs Mock Exam
Students will generally perform worse under timed conditions so it is important to differentiate between whether the student has completed the work under timed conditions or not. Some texts such as Jane Eyre and Dorian Gray have been assessed under both conditions so it may be worth comparing the performance of the two.

Worksheet data is completed at home.
Mock exam data is completed in timed conditions.

Children
The students are children between 8-11. Depending on their engagement levels at the time of completion, they may not put in their full effort or concentration when completing their homework.
ðŸ‘£ Process
Cleaning
There is a substantial amount of data that would need to be organised. Each piece of work includes its original passage, questions to the passage, multiple-choice options for each, student response data and student data. On top of all of this, there are the metrics to each. You should aim to have all the data imported and organised first.

General Analysis
There are quite a few aspects that can be initially analysed to get a better understanding of the students and the passages/questions. You may consider analysing passage/questions so that they can be organised by difficulty, question types or even topic. You may also consider building student profiles to have a better understanding of the skills of each student: their weaknesses and strengths etc.

Predicting Student Responses (Part 1)
The first part of the project will be to use student profiles and your understanding of each passage to predict whether a student will get an answer right or wrong.

Predicting Student Responses (Part 2)
The second stage of the project will be to predict the exact multiple-choice option that a student will choose in a test. This is much harder as it would require additional analysis of each multiple-choice option. You may consider analysing or producing a model that is able to recognise the tendencies of students' choices or the style of the multiple-choice option.

Ranking
Final ranking position will be awarded based upon:
the smallest test set
highest accuracy rate in part 1
highest accuracy rate in part 2
